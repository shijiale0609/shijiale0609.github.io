Biography
---------

I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), under the supervision of [**Prof. Bradley D. Olsen**](https://cheme.mit.edu/profile/bradley-d-olsen/) (MIT) and [**Dr. Debra J. Audus**](https://www.nist.gov/people/debra-audus) (NIST). My postdoc research focuses on utilizing polymer physics, chemical informatics and machine learning to explore the mechanism of polymer systems and accelerate the discovery and design of the next generation of sustainable and functional polymeric materials.

Previously, I did my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame with [**Prof. Jonathan K. Whitmer**](https://www3.nd.edu/~jwhitme1/). I utilized molecular simulation, enhanced sampling and machine learning to study the free energy landscapes of materials, and help people understand the mechanisms and design new materials. I received my B.S. in Chemistry at Peking University. I finished my undergraduate thesis on utilizing DFT to study the stability and electric structure of mixed halide perovskite, under the supervision of [**Prof. Hong Jiang**](https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/en/faculty/researchareas/physical/86784.htm).
